The game will guide players through a narrative sequence of events, each requiring the player to learn new information regarding life principles, and then pass a test based on the newly acquired knowledge. Players are able to learn the core ideas of life, and how their lives might be improved if they take the principles to heart. The gameâ€™s setting is a mixture of reality and fantasy, where the player mainly avoids obstacles, collects knowledge and progresses through the game in a sequential manner. 
The game depicted only the first level as it was not required by the course to build a full game.
